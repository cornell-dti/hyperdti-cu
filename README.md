## Want to Contribute?

I built this in 24 hours (Sunday, Mar 19th). I would be wholly unsurprised by the presence of bugs.

Please! Open an issue or a PR if you find any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Protection against possible attacks by bots.
- [ ] Authentication for DTI members -- especially to view the Hub.
- [ ] Password gate should redirect-- not hide.
