# HyperDTI

A simple URL shortener written in TypeScript, built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), built on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Features

- Create Short URLs that are automatically copied to your clipboard upon generation.
- Create custom aliases for your URLs, if you want.
- View a list of all your recently-created short URLs; click on any of them to copy it to your clipboard.
- URL Validation upon form submission.

## Want to Contribute?

I built this in 24 hours (Sunday, Mar 19th). I would be wholly unsurprised by the presence of bugs.

Please! Open an issue or a PR if you find any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements.

## Tentative Roadmap

- [ ] Authentication for DTI members + a centralized Hub for all DTI-related links.
